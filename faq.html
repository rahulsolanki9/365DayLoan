They are typically paid back in monthly or bi-monthly installments over  an extended period of time. Personal loans can be a convenient  alternative to bank loans or high-interest credit cards, with online  request forms and no-hassle automated repayment.

                        <h5>Possible Implications</h5>
                        <p>When borrowing, it is important to understand the implications that may happen if you do not adhere to the terms and agreement of your loan. We have listed here the possible implications and stress that you fully read and understand the terms of any loan offered to you before making a final decision to proceed.</p>
                        <h5>Late or Non Payment</h5>
                        <p>By accepting the terms and conditions for a personal loan, you essentially agree to repay the loan both: 1) with interest and 2) in the time frame specified in the loan agreement. In most cases, failure to repay the loan in full, or making a late payment, can result in additional charges. Modoloan.com has NO ability to predict or estimate what supplemental charges will be incurred in the event of late, partial, or non-payment.LoanToday.com also has NO control or knowledge of any loan agreements or details between you and your lender. Please carefully review the late, partial, and non-payment policies that your lender provides with your loan agreement.LoanToday.com works hard to partner with only the most trustworthy and reputable lenders who pursue the collection of past-due loan accounts in a fair and reasonable manner.</p>
                        <h5>Credit Score Impact</h5>
                        <p>Our lenders may perform credit checks to determine your credit worthiness, credit standing and/or credit capacity. By submitting your request you agree to allow our lenders to verify your personal information and check your credit. Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment can negatively impact your credit score.</p>
                        <h5>Collection Practices</h5>
                        <p>LoanToday.com is not a lender and, because of this, we have NO involvement in the debt collection process. As part of the lending agreement provided to you by the lender, they will disclose their debt collection practices. If you have any collection questions, please contact the lender for complete details.LoanToday.com only works with reputable lenders who use fair collection practices.</p> 
                        <p class="">(*) – Three minutes is the average time taken to complete the online loan offer process, submit your details and receive a loan offer decision if approved.<br>
                            (**) – Although some providers offer rates from 4.95% up to 35.99% APR rates that low are only available to certain customers. The repayment terms are for close end loan products, <br>
                            and is not reflective of all loan products offered in our network.
